## Placeholder Instructions

If you don't have actual 3D avatar images yet, you can create placeholder text files with these names, and the app will display placeholder rectangles until you provide the real images.

## Creating Your Own Images

Consider using 3D avatar creator tools or services like:
- Ready Player Me
- Avataaars Generator 
- Picrew
- Adobe Fuse CC

You can then export the avatars with different expressions to match the requirements.
